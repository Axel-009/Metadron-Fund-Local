Metadron Capital — Shared API Singletons

All routers import broker/engine instances from here to ensure
consistent state across tabs. No more independent ExecutionEngine()
per router module.

BROKER SWAP NOTE:
    To change the active broker, set METADRON_BROKER_TYPE env var:
        "alpaca"  — AlpacaBroker (default, requires ALPACA_API_KEY)
        "paper"   — PaperBroker (simulation only)
        "tradier" — TradierBroker (requires TRADIER_API_KEY, not yet wired in ExecutionEngine)
        "ibkr"    — IBKRBroker (future — implement broker_protocol.BrokerProtocol)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROBLEM SOLVED BY THIS MODULE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before this file existed, each router (portfolio.py, risk.py, execution.py)
called ExecutionEngine() independently inside its own lazy singleton function.
This created three separate ExecutionEngine instances — each with its own
broker, its own trade log, and its own PortfolioState — so dashboard tabs
showed inconsistent data (Audit Bug 4).

This module provides a single, process-wide ExecutionEngine.  Every router
that needs the broker, l7 surface, beta corridor, or options engine imports
from here:

    from engine.api.shared import get_broker, get_engine, get_l7, get_beta, get_options

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW BROKER TYPE IS SELECTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Read METADRON_BROKER_TYPE from environment (default: "alpaca").
2. Pass as broker_type to ExecutionEngine.__init__().
3. ExecutionEngine selects AlpacaBroker or PaperBroker based on that value.
4. TradierBroker / IBKRBroker are not yet wired in ExecutionEngine — see
   engine/execution/broker_protocol.py BROKER SWAP NOTES for wiring steps.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FALLBACK BEHAVIOUR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If ExecutionEngine() raises (e.g. missing ALPACA_API_KEY), this module falls
back to a bare PaperBroker() and logs a WARNING.  This mirrors the behaviour
of the old portfolio.py and risk.py _get_broker() functions so the dashboard
remains usable in dev / CI environments without broker credentials.

To suppress the fallback and force a hard error on missing credentials, set:
    METADRON_BROKER_STRICT=true

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THREAD SAFETY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A single threading.Lock (_init_lock) guards all singleton initialisations.
FastAPI runs request handlers in a thread pool, so concurrent first-requests
on startup could race to create multiple instances without this guard.

The lock is only held during the first initialisation of each singleton — once
the object is created it is stored in the module-level variable and subsequent
calls read it without acquiring the lock.

    AI NOTE — What is ExecutionEngine?
    ────────────────────────────────────
    ExecutionEngine is the main trading pipeline orchestrator.  It owns:
        - self.broker      : the active broker (AlpacaBroker or PaperBroker)
        - self.l7          : L7UnifiedExecutionSurface (HFT arm)
        - self.macro       : MacroEngine (regime detection)
        - self.cube        : MetadronCube (signal generation)
        - self.alpha       : AlphaOptimizer (signal ranking)
        - self.beta        : BetaCorridor (futures hedging)
        - self.risk_gates  : RiskGateManager (8-gate pre-trade check)
        - self.ensemble    : MLVoteEnsemble (10-tier weighted vote)
        - self.allocator   : TradeAllocator (position sizing)

    BROKER SWAP EFFECT:
        Changing METADRON_BROKER_TYPE= changes which broker ExecutionEngine
        selects in its __init__().  The rest of the pipeline is broker-agnostic
        — it calls self.broker.place_order() regardless of implementation.

    FALLBACK:
        If ExecutionEngine() raises (e.g. missing Alpaca credentials) and
        METADRON_BROKER_STRICT is not set, a minimal PaperBroker is wrapped
        in a FallbackEngine stub so callers always receive a valid object.
        This prevents 500 errors on all execution/portfolio/risk endpoints.

    AI NOTE — What is the broker?
    ──────────────────────────────
    The broker is the lowest-level order-execution object.  It is always one
    of: PaperBroker, AlpacaBroker, or TradierBroker (future: IBKRBroker).
    All three satisfy BrokerProtocol.

    You can confirm at runtime:
        from engine.execution.broker_protocol import BrokerProtocol
        assert isinstance(get_broker(), BrokerProtocol)

    BROKER SWAP EFFECT:
        The returned broker changes based on METADRON_BROKER_TYPE:
            "alpaca"  → AlpacaBroker (connects to Alpaca brokerage API)
            "paper"   → PaperBroker  (fully simulated, no external calls)
            "tradier" → TradierBroker (not yet wired — falls back to paper)
            "ibkr"    → IBKRBroker  (future implementation)

    All routers should call get_broker() instead of instantiating brokers
    directly.  This is the fix for Audit Bug 4 (singleton isolation).

    Usage in a router:
        from engine.api.shared import get_broker

    AI NOTE — What is L7?
    ──────────────────────
    L7 is the "fused continuous execution arm" that unifies:
        - WonderTrader (micro-price + CTA signals)
        - ExchangeCore (order matching ring buffer)
        - AlpacaBroker / PaperBroker (bookkeeping)
        - OptionsEngine (Greeks and hedging)
        - QuantStrategyExecutor (12 technical strategies)
        - BetaCorridor (futures hedging)
        - L7RiskEngine (10-gate pre-trade check)
        - TransactionCostAnalyzer (TCA)
        - SlippageModel
        - ExecutionLearningLoop

    L7's submit_order() is a 10-step pipeline that classifies the product
    type (EQUITY / OPTION / FUTURE / ETF / CRYPTO), runs pre-trade risk,
    routes to the appropriate sub-executor, and logs TCA metrics.

    BROKER SWAP EFFECT:
        L7 internally creates its own broker instance (separate from
        ExecutionEngine's broker) via the same broker_type convention.
        This is a known architectural issue — ideally L7 should receive
        the broker from the shared singleton rather than creating its own.
        Until that refactor is done, L7's broker and ExecutionEngine's broker
        are separate instances pointing to the same Alpaca account.

    BUG NOTE (from audit):
        /execution/l7/status returns {} because the router checks for
        l7.get_status() and l7.status() — neither exists.  The correct
        method is l7.get_execution_summary().  Fix: update execution.py
        to call l7.get_execution_summary() directly.

def get_beta() -> "_BetaCorridor":

    AI NOTE — What is BetaCorridor?
    ────────────────────────────────
    BetaCorridor manages the portfolio's beta relative to SPY (or a
    configurable benchmark).  It:
        - Computes current portfolio beta from position weights and
          historical correlations (via OpenBB data)
        - Maintains a target beta corridor (e.g. 0.6 – 1.1)
        - Triggers BetaAction (REDUCE / INCREASE / HOLD) when beta drifts
          outside the corridor
        - Drives beta rebalance orders in ExecutionEngine.run() via
          self.broker.place_order(ticker="SPY", ...) — see Audit Bug 5
          (SPY is hardcoded; no config for alternate benchmark)

    Risk endpoints that use BetaCorridor:
        /risk/portfolio  — get_corridor_analytics()
        /risk/beta/stress — stress_test_beta()
        /risk/beta/history — get_beta_history_df()

    BROKER SWAP EFFECT:
        BetaCorridor is broker-agnostic — it reads position weights from
        the PortfolioState it receives and fetches SPY prices via OpenBB.
        Swapping the broker does not affect BetaCorridor behaviour unless
        the new broker's get_all_positions() returns a different Position
        shape (which BrokerProtocol prevents).

    NOTE:
        The shared ExecutionEngine already creates its own BetaCorridor as
        self.beta.  For most use cases, prefer engine.beta from get_engine()
        to avoid a second instance.  This getter exists for routers that
        need BetaCorridor without instantiating the full ExecutionEngine

    OptionsEngine manages the options book and provides:

        - Portfolio Greeks: aggregate delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho
        - Vol surface construction (implied vol by strike/expiry)
        - Hedge requirement computation (delta neutral hedging cost)
        - Regime-based strategy matrix (which options strategy fits
          current macro regime: bull spread, bear spread, straddle, etc.)
        - L7 integration: _execute_option() in L7 routes all OPTION
          product orders through OptionsEngine

    BROKER SWAP EFFECT:
        OptionsEngine is broker-agnostic at the read level (Greeks, vol

        L7's _execute_option() which calls AlpacaBroker.place_order()
        with appropriate option contract params.  Swapping to IBKR would
        require updating L7._execute_option() to use the IBKR options API.

    NOTE:
        OptionsEngine is a heavyweight object (loads volatility surface
        data on init).  Initialise it once and reuse.  This singleton
        ensures the /risk endpoints and L7 share the same instance.
