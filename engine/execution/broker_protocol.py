BrokerProtocol — Formal typing.Protocol for all Metadron broker implementations.

Defines the shared interface that PaperBroker, AlpacaBroker, and TradierBroker
all implement by convention. This Protocol makes that contract explicit and
runtime-checkable via isinstance().

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BROKER SWAP NOTES — READ BEFORE ADDING A NEW BROKER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All brokers (PaperBroker, AlpacaBroker, TradierBroker) share a single interface
by convention.  BrokerProtocol formalises that contract so:
  (a) type checkers (mypy, pyright) catch mismatches at dev-time, and
  (b) runtime guards like `assert isinstance(broker, BrokerProtocol)` work.

HOW TO ADD IBKR (or any other new broker):
────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 1 — Import shared dataclasses from paper_broker.py
    The paper_broker module is the canonical source of all shared data types.
    AlpacaBroker already does this pattern — copy it:

        from engine.execution.paper_broker import (
            Order, OrderSide, OrderType, OrderStatus, SignalType,
            Position, PortfolioState, RiskLimiter, PerformanceTracker,
            DailyTargetManager, LiveDashboardState, RiskProfile,
        )

    DO NOT redefine these types — share the originals so isinstance() checks
    remain consistent across all brokers and routers.

STEP 2 — Implement all Protocol methods
    Your new broker class must implement every method listed in BrokerProtocol
    below.  The minimal required surface is:

        place_order, get_trade_history, get_portfolio_summary,
        get_all_positions, compute_nav, compute_exposures, get_drawdown,
        refresh_prices, get_risk_profile, get_daily_target_state,
        reset_daily_target, get_leverage_multiplier, emit_dashboard_state,
        get_dashboard_snapshot, get_dashboard_history,
        register_dashboard_callback, get_performance_metrics,
        get_daily_pnl, reconcile, export_positions_csv

    And required attributes:
        state            : PortfolioState
        _perf_tracker    : PerformanceTracker
        _daily_pnl_today : float
        paper            : bool

    TIP — get_trade_history() MUST return list[dict], not list[Order].
    All three current brokers return dicts.  The router attribute-access bug
    (portfolio.py, risk.py) uses t.get("ticker") dict access in several places;
    keeping the dict return type preserves compatibility.

STEP 3 — Wire the broker into ExecutionEngine and L7
    Open engine/execution/execution_engine.py and add a branch in
    ExecutionEngine.__init__() alongside the existing "alpaca" / "paper" paths:

        elif broker_type == "ibkr":
            from engine.execution.ibkr_broker import IBKRBroker
            self.broker = IBKRBroker(initial_cash=initial_nav or 1_000_000.0)

    Then repeat the same addition in
    engine/execution/l7_unified_execution_surface.py inside
    L7UnifiedExecutionSurface.__init__() (L7 silently falls back to paper on
    failure, so wrap in try/except following the existing pattern there).

    Environment variable convention — add to .env / README:
        METADRON_BROKER_TYPE=ibkr      # or alpaca / paper / tradier

    The shared singleton module (engine/api/shared.py) already reads
    METADRON_BROKER_TYPE and forwards it to ExecutionEngine().

STEP 4 — Validate compliance at import time
    Add this assertion at the bottom of your new broker file:

        # Validate Protocol compliance at import time
        assert isinstance(IBKRBroker(initial_cash=0), BrokerProtocol), (
            "IBKRBroker does not satisfy BrokerProtocol — add missing methods."
        )

    Or write a unit test:

        from engine.execution.broker_protocol import BrokerProtocol
        from engine.execution.ibkr_broker import IBKRBroker

        def test_ibkr_satisfies_protocol():
            broker = IBKRBroker(initial_cash=100_000)
            assert isinstance(broker, BrokerProtocol)

STEP 5 — Update the shared.py BROKER SWAP NOTE
    Edit the docstring at the top of engine/api/shared.py to list the new
    broker type so other developers know it exists.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRADIER BROKER STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TradierBroker is already fully implemented at:
    engine/execution/tradier_broker.py

It satisfies BrokerProtocol (same method surface as PaperBroker /
AlpacaBroker).  However, it is NOT yet wired into ExecutionEngine or
L7UnifiedExecutionSurface — there is no broker_type="tradier" path in either
class's __init__().

To activate TradierBroker, follow Step 3 above with:

    elif broker_type == "tradier":
        from engine.execution.tradier_broker import TradierBroker
        self.broker = TradierBroker(initial_cash=initial_nav or 1_000_000.0)

And set:
    METADRON_BROKER_TYPE=tradier
    TRADIER_API_KEY=<your-key>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SINGLETON / IMPORT NOTE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All routers should import broker/engine instances from engine/api/shared.py
(not instantiate them directly) to avoid the singleton isolation problem
documented in the audit (Bug 4).  The shared module ensures a single
ExecutionEngine — and therefore a single broker — is shared across all tabs.

    AI NOTE — Why Protocol instead of ABC?
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Using ``typing.Protocol`` rather than ``abc.ABC`` means existing broker
    classes do NOT need to be modified (no need to add ``(BrokerABC)`` to
    their class definitions).  All three current brokers satisfy this Protocol
    by structural subtyping — their method signatures already match.
